# Resources

## Figma file

The Figma file can be downloaded [here](resources/example_figma_template.fig), and the JSON downloaded [here](resources/calendar.json). The plugin we used during the hackathon was [JSON to Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789839703871161985/JSON-to-Figma), but any similar plugin should work fine.

To get around ScreenCloud playersâ€™ iframe limitation, we recommend putting Figma embeds inside our [example HTML file](resources/embed.html), then host it using services like Github Pages. The resulting link can be added to ScreenCloud via the Links feature.

## ScreenCloud API

We used the ScreenCloud API to switch content on our screens. In our case, we used `setScreenContentByLinkId` for simplicity, but similar calls for channels, playlists, etc should work the exact same way. More info on the API can be found on the [developer website](https://screencloud.github.io/signage-next-graphql-docs/).

```GraphQL
mutation {
  setScreenContentByLinkId(input: {
    clientMutationId: "Switch Links",
    linkId: "9b1c1755-c43f-4c9e-94a7-5f6c5710e05c",
    screenId: "f7580bf7-9605-421c-a951-9c4cf424cb5e"
  })  {
    clientMutationId
  }
}
```

Screen ID and channel/link/playlist IDs can be queried using `allChannels` (or similar), or via Studio Audit Logs.

```GraphQL
allChannels(filter: {draftOf: {isNull: true}}) {      
    nodes {
    id
    name
    }
}
```

The best use for this is to implement trigger conditions, ie. trigger content switching when we have a new error in our dashboard, etc.

This is a very compelling usecase in addition to time-based looping content.
